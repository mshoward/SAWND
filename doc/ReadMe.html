The VAD structure xml document opens with draw.io from google docs <br>
you can open draw.io directly from<br>
<a href="http://www.draw.io">www.draw.io</a><br>
you'll probably be asked to hook it up to google, it's a good idea. <br>

Really, this is a super complicated project, apparently, and that diagram is really needed in order
to fully understand it.  I guess I should upload it as a png, too.  <br>

I guess this will be a work log, too?
