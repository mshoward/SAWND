The VAD structure xml document opens with draw.io from google docs
you can open draw.io directly from [www.draw.io](http://www.draw.io)
you'll probably be asked to hook it up to google, it's a good idea.

Really, this is a super complicated project, apparently, and that diagram is really needed in order
to fully understand it.  I guess I should upload it as a png, too.

I guess this will be a work log, too?
